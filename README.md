## Hi there 👋

- Technology choices are good, but good products come first.
- I enjoy contributing to Django and related libraries, as well as Python libraries in general!
- If there's anything I can help with, please feel free to contact me anytime via email at **jaehyuck.sa.dev@gmail.com**.

### etc.
- I love chatting with people, so if you’d like to grab a coffee chat, just drop me an email(jaehyuck.sa.dev@gmail.com). Always happy to connect! I’m based in Seoul, but online chats are totally fine too.
